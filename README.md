## Developing a fun and easy e-commerce website!

Currently working on making it fully functional with a backend to support buying and shipping abilities. However, I utilized commerce.js react.js and many React hooks to make an e-commerce website to sell basketball jerseys. Using commerce.js made this much easier as I pulled data from my account to display an image of the jersey, price, name of jersey and a brief description. Working on implementing forms to finalize a purchase such as an address form, payment form and confirmation form!
